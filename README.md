# A-Path-Finding-Visualizer-
A simple visualizer for the A* pathfinding algorithm written in python using pygame. 

After running the program the first left click places the starting point (pink in color). Right clicking this point will erase the mark and allow you to replace the mark on some other point.

The Second left click will place the end point (orange in color) for which the program will search for. Right clicking this point will erase the mark and allow you to replace the mark on some other point.

After placing the starting and ending point the next left clicks will allow the user to place barriers (black in color) around which the algorithm will search.

Hitting space bar will start the visualizer.

Here is a sample run of the visualizer.
